## hello,
## i'm jo√£o, a young and dedicated code learner looking to have a bigger understanding of many things related to it.
## i have reactivated this github account from the dead so i have a place to upload all my work to, since it forces me
## to write decent looking code and functional code, at that. github also keeps me accountable to do a little work
## towards my goal every day.
##
## as of right now, i will be dedicating the next few weeks to my end of year exams (geometry and chemistry/physics)
## and nights and weekends season 5, the event hosted by buildspace, as access to a community such as that one is incredibly priceless.
